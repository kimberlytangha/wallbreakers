1. Two Sum
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)    [Solution](https://github.com/kimberlytangha/wallbreakers/blob/master/week2/two_sum.cpp)

- Came up with O(n) suboptimal solution 
- Could be more elegant using arary [256] to hold vowels. Set vowels to 1 and constants to 0. Check if char has 1/0 in the array. 
***

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/description/)    [Solution](https://github.com/kimberlytangha/wallbreakers/blob/master/week2/friend_circles.cpp)
- Had trouble understanding how to determine the number of circles
- Tried to find patterns => noticed that if you listed the number and all of its friends and check their friends in a sort of DFS, you could rule out that friend group.
- Not sure how to code up the traversal through graph 
- Super helpful to draw out adj matrix to visualize graph!
- REDO
