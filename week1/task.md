# WallBreakers Week #1

Goals For This Week

Programming Language Selection
By the end of this week we would like you to decide which programming language you will study in this course.  We strongly recommend that you stick with the language throughout the program, including for both coding exercises and the mock interviews. 

Why is this important? Because for coding interviews, it is key to become fluent in at least one language. If you are unsure, we recommend Python. The resources section at the bottom this document links to multiple good sources for learning or brushing up on Python basics. We also want to make sure you are comfortable writing basic code in your programming language of choice. To help with this, our coding exercises for this week will cover basics such as handling arrays, basic mathematics and modular arithmetic, bitwise operations, and simple string manipulation. 

Repeat, Repeat

Try to solve as many of the coding exercises as you can, even the ones you think are easy! We believe repetition is key to mastery and competence when it comes to coding and we want to get you doing as much coding as possible. We even recommend solving the same problem in different ways, and finding ways to write shorter and more efficient solutions. If you finish all the problems we have linked to, you can solve related problems. LeetCode shows related problems after you submit a working solution.

After solving (or giving up on) a problem – take notes. Record what your thinking process was and how you came up with your solution. LeetCode allows you take notes for each problem (click on the “Notes” link on the very right of the screen to take notes). Your notes will help you fill in the progress report form that we require from you at the end of the week.
