# WallBreakers Week #2

Goals For This Week

Hash maps and hash sets are arguably the most important data structures you will need for coding interviews, as you might have noticed this during our first mock interview. They come up all the time either directly, or indirectly (say as part of memorization, building a graph, etc.). This week we want to make sure you are very comfortable using hash maps and hash sets in your language of choice. You should be able to use them without needing to try to remember or look up the right API or syntax. We will also look at multisets which are a special type of hash maps used for counting occurrences of objects.

Week 2 Checklist

Solve as many of the problems listed below as you can by EOD Sunday, May 12th.

Multisets
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string
Use a multiset for this one. You can also solve it without using one. How? Try to solve it both ways. How do the two solutions compare?
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string
- [?] https://leetcode.com/problems/subdomain-visit-count
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency
- [X] https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch
This one has a few “clever” solutions but feel free to use a simple multiset solution.
- [?] https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms
This one is more difficult than the average interview question but it is good exercise! You will need to build a simple parser in addition to using a multiset.
